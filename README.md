# HomeHive 🐝🏠 - CrackedDevs Hackathon Solo Project

Welcome to HomeHive, my personal journey in the CrackedDevs Hackathon to revolutionize home inventory management using the latest tech.


## Quick Precursor

Before ChatGPT takes my thunder of better grammar, and language I thought I would put in my own words here: 

Hello,

My name is Caleb! 

This has been a way for me to test how rapidly I can deploy a standard of an application from fresh thoughts using ChatGPT. I have been using tools, and structure over the last few years to create what I know is an amazing stack that can be improved by playing, trying, and going further with tools I am unfamiliar with. 

I only started this last night when I stumbled across it online. 

The idea of a Home Inventory app has been in my head to try and attempt a way to push all of my personal items into a simple scan to database application. I want to establish great bones on the framework, and then play around with it as much as I can once I am complete the hackathon to start organizing my life as clean as this code is. Quick, but great structure. 

I want to always do more with something out of my comfort zone, but I know I need to keep it structured:
- mkdocs in a container to track documents, snippets, and code for later I was generating using ChatGPT
- SvelteKit.... but I quickly decided against that and went with Astro which I had never played with before, but was on my list to install for a while.
- TypeORM. I have used Prisma in other projects, but I wanted to see the difference in using something more lightweight.
- Authentication using passkey. I haven't spent enough time on this yet with my project, but I have some great structure ready to implement some new libraries I found along the way.

While the ChatGPT generated stuff below is not really complete, I will get these things done in time, but for now this was a great way to spend my evening last night, and tonight. I took time to reflect on the skills I have grown in the last few years, and got ChatGPT to be witty along the way with my commits. Can't do that in production (as much).

Run this in GitPod, and you can use `npm run dev` in the frontend/homehive folder to start the instance for the frontend. 

Images to follow shortly.
